### Python Guessing Game  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/djouher-al/Python_WordGame)

#### Description:
Developed "The Great Guessing Game," a Python command-line application challenging users to guess a 4-letter word. Implemented features such as clear screen functionality, game modes (Play and Test), and scoring system, providing an engaging user experience.

#### Skills Showcased:
- **Python Programming:** Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, utilizing core language features for game logic implementation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Applied OOP principles by creating a `Game` class to manage game state and functionality.
- **File Handling:** Used file handling techniques to manage external data files containing word databases.
- **String Manipulation:** Employed string manipulation for processing user input and displaying game status.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development:** Developed a CLI using Python's `os` module for screen clearing and argparse for command-line argument parsing.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling mechanisms to ensure application stability and reliability.
- **Documentation:** Provided clear documentation and comments to enhance code readability and maintainability.





###  Simple Data Generation Application (C) 
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/djouher-al/C_Data-Generation-App)

#### Description:
Developed "TableGen," a simple data generation application designed to create realistic test sets for databases or other data management systems. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to build custom tables with specified columns, row counts, and output file names.

#### Skills Showcased:
- **C Programming:** Demonstrated proficiency in C programming, implementing core functionalities and user interfaces for data generation.
- **Menu System:** Designed a menu-driven interface with options for building a table, selecting columns, defining sort criteria, and specifying output details.
- **File I/O:** Utilized file input/output operations to manage the generation and storage of data tables in CSV format.
- **Clearing Screen:** Implemented screen clearing functionality for a clean display using the system function from the stdlib.h library.
- **Data Formatting:** Ensured proper formatting of generated data, including header rows, column order, sorting, and formatting of phone numbers.
- **User Input Handling:** Implemented robust user input handling to validate and process user-provided data, ensuring smooth interaction and preventing errors.
- **Confirmation Messages:** Provided clear confirmation messages to inform users about successful table generation and prompt for further actions.
- **Continuation Prompt:** Implemented a continuation prompt allowing users to return to the main menu for further actions or to exit the program gracefully.


###  Ladder and Snake Game (JAVA)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/djouher-al/Java_Ladder-Snake_game)

#### Description:
Developed a Java application called "Ladder-Snake Game" based on the popular board game concept. The project aimed to recreate the classic gameplay experience in a digital format using Java programming language, providing an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.

#### Skills Showcased:
- **Java Programming:** Demonstrated proficiency in Java programming language, implementing core game mechanics, user interface elements, and game logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Applied OOP principles to design and structure the game, using classes and objects to represent game entities such as players, board cells, and game rules.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development:** Developed a graphical user interface using Java Swing framework, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface for players to interact with the game.
- **Event Handling:** Implemented event handling mechanisms to capture user input, respond to player actions, and update the game state accordingly.
- **Game Logic Implementation:** Implemented the logic for game rules, including movement of players, handling of ladder and snake interactions, and determining game outcomes.
- **Data Structures:** Utilized appropriate data structures such as arrays, lists, or maps to represent game elements and manage game state efficiently.
- **Code Organization:** Organized the codebase into modular components, separating concerns and promoting code reusability, readability, and maintainability.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Conducted testing and debugging to identify and resolve issues, ensuring the stability and reliability of the game application.
- **Documentation:** Provided documentation, comments, and/or README file to explain the project structure, implementation details, and how to run the game, facilitating understanding and usage for other developers and users.
